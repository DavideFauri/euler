# Project Euler

These are my attempts at solving the Project Euler challenges using different programming languages.
I do these challenges occasionally, so there might be some time since my last commit.

Ye be warned that:

 * there will not be many comments explaining the solutions;
 * first I write working code, then efficient code, then idiomatic code;
 * sometimes I over-engineer solutions, just to play with different coding techniques;
 * please don't run my solutions without at least a honest attempt at solving the problems yourself - it's part of the fun!
