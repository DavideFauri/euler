# Project Euler

These are my attempts at solving the Project Euler challenges using different programming languages.
I do these challenges occasionally, so there might be some time since my last commit.

DO NOT:

  * expect to see good code, clean code, well-commented code;
  * expect me to be efficient: I'm using the challenges to learn different types of coding techniques, so sometimes I'll go for the most complicated answers just to test a new concept;
  * run my solutions without at least a honest attempt at figuring out the answers yourself - it's part of the fun!
